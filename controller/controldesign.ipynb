    "In order to respond to elevated levels and rates of CO2 without using too much energy (that is, without keeping the lights on high all the time), a PID controller is created. \n",
    "\n",
    "Term P is proportional to the current value of the $SP-PV$ error. So, if the error is large the control output, the voltage, will be proportionately large, leading to bright lights and a high photosynthesis rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Term I accounts for past values of the $SP−PV$ error and integrates them over time to produce the I term. For example, if there is a residual $SP−PV$ error after the application of proportional control, the integral term seeks to eliminate the residual error by adding a control effect due to the historic cumulative value of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Term D is a best estimate of the future trend of the $SP−PV$ error, based on its current rate of change. The more rapid the change, the greater the controlling or damping effect. So, if the CO2 level is increasing rapidly, this term will result in a larger voltage command to the lights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we want to respond to both level and cumulative effect of the CO2, let's try a PI controller. *(actually it might be a PD controller, since we want to respond to high rates with bright lights, but let's try Garbini's suggestion for now.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The tuning constants depend on the response characteristics of the complete loop external to the controller, so we need to derive them.\n",
